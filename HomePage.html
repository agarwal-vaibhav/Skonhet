      There is beauty all around us.
       There is beauty in all that nature has created.
       Nature weaves its trapestry in but the longest sinews,
       so that the beauty of creation is evident in every
       individual strand as it is in the whole fabric.
       And there is an inherent design in the bounty of nature's
       beauty. Every element in nature has a reason, serves a
       purpose and its apposition to the whole lends it its beauty.

      At Skönhet, we think of products that are inspired by nature,
      inspired by beauty, inspired by beautiful design.
      Our products - lights and lamps - illuminate with inspiration
      drawn from design.
