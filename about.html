      We are a motley group of ex-professionals, who are living out an amateurish, maverick dream full of ideas, designs and beauty. Or rather, the lights of our lives. And that leads us to lights - decorative, wall lights, floor lamps, study lamps, what have you. We have architects, engineers, teachers and marketing professionals in our midst. Most of us are part time philosophers, small time businessmen and full time tinkerers. Some of us try to put most of that into something tangible. Something tangible, and the rest not so ... as evinced in our product range that covers the whiole gamut of illumination and might we say ellightened inspiration.
